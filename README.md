# 📍 Location Analyzer v2

> **Production-grade UK postcode analysis tool powering strategic retail expansion.**
> Features live dual-source demographic scraping, a 4-Engine Median Ensemble Machine Learning pipeline (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest) for Time-Series sales forecasting, and an interactive React dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Location Analyzer v2** is a robust Full-Stack AI application designed to evaluate the commercial potential of UK postcodes for new retail branches. By aggregating live data from demographic & transport sources (StreetCheck, CrystalRoof) and piping it through an advanced Machine Learning pipeline, it outputs highly accurate £ Sales Revenue projections.

### Key Capabilities
*   **🕸️ Resilient Live Scraping**: Async Playwright Orchestration scraping `postcodearea.co.uk` and `crystalroof.com` simultaneously upon user request.
*   **🤖 Median Ensemble Forecasting**: Evaluates 12+ demographic features, applies rigorous Scikit-Learn transformations, and generates a 12-month trailing sales forecast by aggregating predictions from XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Random Forest engines.
*   **📊 Interactive React Dashboard**: A beautiful Dark-Mode `Vite` + `React` interface featuring `Leaflet` geospatial mapping and `Recharts` data visualization.
*   **⚡ FastAPI Microservice**: High-concurrency python backend serving `pydantic` validated JSON APIs.

## 🛠️ Architecture

The project follows a decoupled monolithic architecture separating ML logic, the API serving layer, and the client application.

## 🏁 Quick Start

To launch the full-stack application locally, you must run both the Python Backend and the Node.js Frontend simultaneously.

### 1️⃣ Start the FastAPI Backend
Ensure your `conda` environment is activated and dependencies are installed.

```bash
cd location_analyzer_v2
python -m uvicorn src.location_analyzer.api.main:app --reload
```
The API will initialize, load the heavy Median Ensemble `.pkl` artifacts into memory, and begin listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2️⃣ Start the React Frontend
Open a **second terminal window**.

```bash
cd location_analyzer_v2/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit the local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser to interact with the Dashboard.

## 📈 The ML Feature Engineering Pipeline

The inference engine strictly mirrors the training preprocessing rules to prevent data-leakage and shape mismatches:
1.  **Imputation & Capping**: Population outliers bounded.
2.  **Log1p Transforms**: Applied to magnitudes (`population`, `Distance_to_Nearest_Station`).
3.  **KBins Discretizer**: KMeans binning for employment statistics.
4.  **PowerTransformer**: Yeo-Johnson transforms for `C1/C2` social classifications.
5.  **Time Series Synthesis**: A 12-month sequential permutation is generated dynamically and fed into the Median Ensemble for seasonal trend modeling across 4 separate sub-models.

## 🛡️ Anti-Bot & Rate Limiting Disclaimer
The live `POST /predict` endpoint invokes the `InferencePipeline` which connects to external residential websites. To prevent IP bans, the scrapers in `src/scrapers/` must be configured with Rotating Proxies inside your `.env` file before executing high-volume bulk predictions.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The API and ML inference layers are fully covered by integration tests utilizing `pytest`.

```bash
# Run the FastAPI test suite covering scraper logic, serialization, and ML Output
python -m pytest tests/test_api.py -v
```
